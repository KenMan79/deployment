## Mushrooms Finance FAQ

**One sentence to describe Mushrooms Finance?**  
_[Mushrooms Finance](https://mushrooms.finance/) is built with focus on seeking sustainable profit in DeFi universe._

**What are Mushrooms Vaults?**  
_Vaults help to earn passive profit on crypto assets like WETH/WBTC/DAI/USDC, etc. For example, the earning strategies associated with the Vaults will automate your yield farming on Alchemix or Curve by auto-compounding the profit, i.e., Vaults get appreciation in denomination of whatever token you deposited. You will receive mTokens upon Vault deposit which represent your share in that Vault. When you withdraw from the Vault, the mToken share allows you withdraw both principle plus earned profit over the deposit period._  

**What are Mushrooms Farms?**  
_Mushrooms Finance distribute its governance token ([MM Token](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/mm-token) or MM for short) as rewards to all ecosystem participation via liquidity mining (farming). Currently, there are three major categories of farming pools_:  
- _staking mTokens from Vault deposit_
- _staking liquidity Provider (LP) token for MM from Uniswap (MM-USDC) or Sushiswap (MM-ETH or MM-KP3R)_
- _staking MM Token (Super Mario pool)_

**What are Mushrooms Zaps?**  
_[Zap](https://mushrooms.finance/zaps) helps to convert plain single crypto assets into another form, like covert MIR & UST to MIR-UST Uniswap LP or USDC into Curve 3CRV LP or simply wrap ETH into WETH. It is exactly same as you would have on Uniswap or Curve but all via Mushrooms UI with one click._

**What are current fees involved in Mushrooms Finance?**    
_There are 2 main types of fee now. All fees are used to buyback MM and then distributed proportionally among stakers in Super Mario pool_:
- _Vaults: 30% performance split_
- _Vaults: No fee upon withdrawal(some legacy Vaults/Strategies may have a negligible 0.001% fee due to a limitation in existing smart contracts)_

**How is the APY/APR calculated?**  
_We by default display Vault APR based on real-time calculation from underlying earning strategy, instead of APY. For Super Mario farming pool, it also include buyback distribution in additon to basic weekly mining allocation. You could combine both Vault and Farm APR for your invested crypto asset as the final expectd earning rate._

**How do I know the auto-compounding of Vaults work as excpeted?**  
_All vault performance stats are available on our [Dune Analytics](https://duneanalytics.com/mushrooms/mushrooms-finance) dashboard and every new profit harvest() call is pushed to our discord channel #mushrooms-bot. Or you could check on [Etherscan](https://www.etherscan.io) for Vault's getRatio() which represent the crypto asset each unit of mToken share could withdraw._

**Tokenomics?**  
_MM token is mainly for governance in Mushrooms Finance and distributed through fair launch (no public/private sale):_
- _Total supply of 721704 MM to be mined in 4 years, refer to [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa283aa7cfbb27ef0cfbcb2493dd9f4330e0fd304) for current circulation_

**How to participate in the governance?**  
_Currently we hold an off-chain voting portal on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/mushroomsfi.eth/). You need to hold/stake some MM token or stake LP token in Farms to vote._

All deployed Vaults with associated strategies could be found in our Github deployment doc and open-sourced/verfied on etherscan.io._ 

**Any vision or roadmap thing?**  
_There is no written roadmap, but a few things are in mind for this year_:  
- _Long Term: L2/Cross-chain integration_
